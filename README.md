# PrankVirusSim

This project was designed for the purposes of practicing Unix Shell Scripting and Python. 

I have a puppy (black lab/coonhound mix) named Widget. As an energetic puppy, she is always causing trouble, and getting into things she shouldn't. She was the insperation for this "prank" simulated virus. 

The program is hardcoded for my machine at this time, but can easily be adapted to most depending on the user's directory setup. 

The WidgetPySim file is a Unix Shell Script. This simply accesses the needed directories, and launches the Widget python script, which will perform the simulated virus. Everything is scripted in a verbose manner, so that the user can see what is happening.
